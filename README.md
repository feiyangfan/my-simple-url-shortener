## my-simple-url-shortner
A simple URL shortner I am trying to make.  
 The inspiration is that sometimes when I share youtube videos with my friends, the auto-generated link is not the same as what's been showing in the address bar. So I want to know why different URLs can link to the same website. And I want to build my own URL shortner and see if it works.
