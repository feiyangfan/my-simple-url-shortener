# my-simple-url-shortner
A simple URL shortner I am trying to build. The inspiration is that sometimes when I share youtube videos with my friends, the auto-generated link is not the same as what's showing in the address bar. So I want to know why different URLs can link to the same website. And I want to build my own URL shortner.
